# Music Folder

This folder contains your wedding music files.

## Instructions:
1. Copy your MP3 files into this folder
2. Use simple filenames without spaces (e.g., "perfect-ed-sheeran.mp3")
3. Update the `playlist-config.js` file with the correct filenames

## Example file structure:
```
music/
├── perfect-ed-sheeran.mp3
├── all-of-me-john-legend.mp3
├── thinking-out-loud.mp3
├── a-thousand-years.mp3
├── cant-help-myself.mp3
├── make-you-feel-my-love.mp3
├── at-last.mp3
├── marry-me-train.mp3
└── better-days.mp3
```

## File Requirements:
- Format: MP3 (recommended)
- Size: Under 8MB per file for best performance
- Quality: 128-320 kbps
- Naming: Use lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces

Once you add your files here, update the `src` paths in `playlist-config.js` to match your filenames.
